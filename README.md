# playsphere-user-transaction-analysis
This project analyzes user transaction behavior for PlaySphere Interactive, a digital entertainment company specializing in game purchases and digital vouchers.

# Project Initiation
The company wants to understand how total revenue across all products has performed from 2019 to 2022. The analysis is not supporting a specific business decision yet, but aims to give product, marketing, and finance teams a high-level view of trends and patterns in revenue.

# Key summary for surface insights:
1. The key KPI for this explorative analysis is USD price, supported by additional fields such as product name and purchase timestamp.
2. the analysis focuses on identifying aggregate metrics, patterns, outliers, and unexpected anomalies—particularly by examining total revenue by month and product, along with minimum and maximum values.
3. Early insights will also be surfaced by segmenting the data across meaningful dimensions such as region, category, or other user demographics like marketing channel or account creation method.
