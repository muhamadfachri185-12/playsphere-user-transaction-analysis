<h1>playsphere-user-transaction-analysis</h1> 
This project analyzes user transaction behavior for PlaySphere Interactive, an Electronic & Gaming Products Retail company specializing in game purchases and hardware products.

<br>
<h2>Project Initiation</h2> 
The company wants to understand how total revenue across all products has performed from 2019 to 2021. The analysis is not supporting a specific business decision yet, but aims to give product, marketing, and finance teams a high-level view of trends and patterns in revenue.

**Key summary for surface insights:**<br>
1. The key KPI for this explorative analysis is USD price, supported by fields like product name and purchase timestamp.
2. The analysis focuses on identifying aggregate metrics, patterns, outliers, and unexpected anomalies — especially total revenue by month and product, plus min/max values.
3. Early insights will be surfaced by segmenting the data by region, category, marketing channel, or account creation method.
